# The Pale Blue Dot

## General Description
**"The Pale Blue Dot"** is a space simulation game that explores the vastness and beauty of the Earth-Moon system, inspired by the famous photograph taken by the Voyager 1 probe. The player commands a spacecraft and has the freedom to navigate space, exploring the orbits of Earth and the Moon. The game is designed to offer a relaxing and contemplative experience, emphasizing the immensity of the universe and the breathtaking views of our planet and its natural satellite.

## Context
The game takes place in space near Earth's orbit, allowing the player to experience the sensation of weightlessness and navigate close to the planet and the Moon. The player controls a small spacecraft designed to explore and admire the fascinating views of Earth and its natural satellite from a cosmic perspective. The game does not have a complex storyline but focuses on meditation and visual exploration, drawing inspiration from the iconic image of Earth as a "pale blue dot" in the vastness of space.

## Category
**"The Pale Blue Dot"** fits within the Space Simulation and Open-World Exploration genres, with elements of Realistic Physics to simulate orbits and gravity as accurately as possible. The game combines space simulation with open exploration, giving the player freedom of movement and exploration in a vast and realistic environment.

## Gameplay Rules
The player has several actions available:
- Control the spacecraftâ€™s speed (acceleration and deceleration).
- Change direction and rotate the spacecraft along all axes (Pitch, Yaw, and Roll).
- Adjust the orbit by modifying the trajectory to explore different locations (e.g., the Moon's orbit, returning to Earth's orbit).

The game does not have a defined winning or losing objective, focusing instead on exploration and relaxation. **Score** (if implemented) could be based on time spent in various orbits, but the main focus remains on the visual experience.

## User Interaction
Upon entering the game, the user will see an introductory cinematic transitioning from the solar system to Earth's orbit, where the controlled spacecraft is located. The initial interface will be a simple configuration menu where the player can adjust audio settings and time speed. Once in the game, the HUD will include information about altitude, speed, and current position relative to Earth and the Moon. A minimap will show the current orbit and distance from other objects in space. The main available actions will be controlling the spacecraft and modifying settings from a quick-access menu.

## Target Audience
The game is intended for space and astronomy enthusiasts of all ages, especially those who appreciate visual exploration and relaxation in a vast and realistic digital environment.
